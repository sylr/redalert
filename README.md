# redalert

## goal of the project

RedAlert is a basic Slack bot to helps in **incident management** by using Slack channels.

RedAlert is inspired by the work described by ManoMano SRE team in [this blog post](https://medium.com/manomano-tech/incident-management-with-a-bot-7e80deb5b5e5). Unfortunatly, ManoMano's bot (FireFighter) is closed source for now (I've asked its author who confirmed it).

This project aims to provide an open source alternative.

## features

* open a channel, add a small description and invite individuals (TODO, or teams) in it
* configurable incident severity levels
* list all incident channels, (TODO, not working) optionnaly also archived ones (closed incidents)
* close the incident by archiving the Slack channel

## **possible** (as in maybe) future features

* add external persistance to store incidents in an external database to allow better analysis
* custom config file that overrides the default values from config.py
* add **problem management** (linking incidents, adding tasks)
* interact with other systems like:
  * PagerDuty (create an incident to alert "on call" operator), 
  * Trello (tasks)
  * Confluence (postmortems)
  * ...
* add multiple individuals at incident creation ([not possible yet?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48523512/slack-interactive-message-menu-select-multiple))

## prerequisites

* a Slack workspace with enough rights to add app and custom commands (???)
* a server capable of running Flask python webserver with Python 3.6+

## installation

Add the App in you Slack administration

(TODO explain this)

On Ubuntu 18.04

```bash
apt install python3-pip
pip3 install flask slackclient
```

Get the sources

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zwindler/redalert && cd redalert
```

Export SLACK\_BOT\_TOKEN variable (with the value found in the Slack Apps page) and run redalert.py

```bash
export SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx
./redalert.py
```

## Docker image

As an alternative, you can also run or build yourself the Docker image of the redalert flask app

### Build it yourself and run it

Inside redalert repository, simply run `docker build`

```bash
docker build -t redalert .
docker run -it -e SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-own-slack-bot-token redalert
```

### Run it from official image

```bash
docker run -it -e SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-own-slack-bot-token zwindler/redalert
```

##Â Configure it

RedAlert comes with some small level of customisation, including for now only the various incident severity levels (more features coming soon, see **fetures** chapter).

In the near future, you will be able to add a custom configuration file to override the defaults, but for now, you have to override the whole config.py configuration file coming with the repo, either by modifying it or with a docker mount over the file (if you chose Docker to run it)

```bash
docker run -it -e SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-own-slack-bot-token -v custom-config.py:config.py zwindler/redalert
```
